# CoffeeBuddy
Fancy a social or an education encounter in 42 Abu Dhabi? Join in today for your random encounter!

The main purpose of Coffee Buddy is to encourage socializing between peers, for educational and social purposes. Seeing that the campus is grouped mainly on piscine or joining date bases, this project aims to destory the boundries between the student groups and let people go outside their comfort zone. If you are looking for an educational encounter, you will be matched with peers from the same circle as you doing similar projects so you can exchange knowledge and figure things out, while the social encounter will randomly match you with a random peer.

Have fun and Have coffee!!
